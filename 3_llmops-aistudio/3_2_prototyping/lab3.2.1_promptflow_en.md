# Lab 3.2.1 Prototyping a Gen AI app using the fine-tuned model with Azure AI Studio Prompt Flow

### Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription where you can create an AI Hub and AI project Resource.
- Online endpoint of the fine-tuned model in Azure ML Studio
- Deployed gpt-4o model in Azure AI Studio 


### Task

- I want to run a simple PoC on a model that fine-tuned. 
- I want to see what results are generated when I run the prompts. 

### TOC
    1️⃣ Create a basic chat flow 
    2️⃣ Integrate the fine-tuned phi3.5 endpoint into Python Node

### 1️⃣ Create a basic chat flow 

Define the Chat Flow: Create a new chat flow and define the chat flow structure

1. Azure AI Studio > Prompt flow > Click +Create to create a new flow
![create a new flow](images/create_new_flow.jpg)

2. In order to get a user-friendly chat interface, select Chat flow
![select Chat flow](images/create_new_chat_flow.jpg)

3. Put your folder name to store your Promptflow files and click the Create button
![Put your folder name](images/put_folder_name.jpg)

4. Change as raw file model to modify your basic chat flow
![Put your folder name](images/change_raw_file_mode.jpg)

5. Modify flow.dag.yaml and define the new chat flow structure. You can also refer the source code below. 
![Put your folder name](images/modify_dag.jpg)

```
inputs:
  question:
    type: string
    is_chat_input: true
outputs:
  answer:
    type: string
    reference: ${phi35.output}
    is_chat_output: true
nodes:
- name: phi35
  type: python
  source:
    type: code
    path: phi35.py
  inputs:
    question: ${inputs.question}
  
```

6. change the Raw file mode again and Save your modified flow. Make sure that your compute instance is running to execute the updated chat flow

7. review the modified flow

### 2️⃣ Integrate the fine tuned phi3.5 endpoint into Python Node
1. First of all, In order to get the endpoint information to create a connection, Navigate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace you created > Endpoints > Consume tab > Copy the REST endpoint and primary key as the authentication information.
![copy the REST endpoint and primary key](images/copy_endpoint_comsumption_info.jpg)

2. Go back to Azure AI Studio > Settings > Create a new connection to integrate with deployed fine-tuned phi3.5 endpoint. 
![create a new connection](images/create_new_connection.jpg)

3. Select the connection type as Custom keys and put the connection information 
![select the connection type](images/add_custom_keys.jpg)

4. Add the connection information to the Python Node to request the deployed phi3.5 endpoint and click add connection
![add the connection information](images/create_connect_custom_resource.jpg)

5. Attach the code below on your Python Node to request the fine-tuned phi3.5 endpoint. 

{: .note}
Since this endpoint is based on fine-tuned online endpoints in Azure Machine Learning, the input and output specifications follow the scoring script provided in the previous step on 2_slm-fine-tuning-mlstudio. Please check the [score.py](../../2_slm-fine-tuning-mlstudio/phi3/src_serve/score.py) file in the Azure ML studio to get the input and output format. If you want to understand the scoring_script, please refer to the [Understand the scoring script](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-online-endpoints?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=python#understand-the-scoring-script).

```python
import urllib
import json
from promptflow import tool
from promptflow.connections import CustomConnection


def chat(input_data: str, connection: CustomConnection) -> str:
    
    # Request data goes here
    # The example below assumes JSON formatting which may be updated
    # depending on the format your endpoint expects.
    # More information can be found here:
    # https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-advanced-entry-script
    data = {
        "input_data": 
            [
                {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me Microsoft's brief history."},
                {"role": "assistant", "content": "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell a BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800."},
                {"role": "user", "content": input_data}
            ],
        "params": {
                "temperature": 0.7,
                "max_new_tokens": 512,
                "do_sample": True,
                "return_full_text": False
        }
    }

    body = str.encode(json.dumps(data))

    url = connection.endpoint
    # Replace this with the primary/secondary key, AMLToken, or Microsoft Entra ID token for the endpoint
    api_key = connection.key
    if not api_key:
        raise Exception("A key should be provided to invoke the endpoint")


    headers = {'Content-Type':'application/json', 'Authorization':('Bearer '+ api_key)}

    req = urllib.request.Request(url, body, headers)

    try:
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(req)

        response = response.read().decode()
        print(response)
        
        result = json.loads(response)["result"]
        
        return result
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as error:
        print("The request failed with status code: " + str(error.code))

        # Print the headers - they include the requert ID and the timestamp, which are useful for debugging the failure
        print(error.info())
        print(error.read().decode("utf8", 'ignore'))

@tool
def my_python_tool(input_data: str, connection: CustomConnection) -> str:
    """
    Tool function to process input data and query the Phi-3 model.
    """
    return chat(input_data, connection)
```

6. add the input parameters of the Python Node to request the deployed phi3.5 endpoint.
![add the connection and input_data](images/validate_parsing_input.jpg)

7. Save the Python Node and run the chat flow to test the phi3.5 model
![test phi3.5 model](images/save_open_chat_window.jpg)

8. Let's test phi3.5 model on the chat window
