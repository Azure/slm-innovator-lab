# Lab 3.3 Scenario 3: Evaluate your models using Prompt Flow to keep optimizing

## Overview
In this lab, you will explore the AI-powered evaluation capabilities in Azure AI Studio and perform A/B testing with your LLM nodes to evaluate the performance of the prompt and LLM. You will learn how to create your variants, which can help you test the model's behavior under different conditions, such as different wording, formatting, context, temperature, or top-k, compare, and find the best prompt and configuration that maximizes the model's accuracy, diversity, or coherence.
