      "solution_prefix": "Determine the quantity of four-digit numerals surpassing 2999 that can be constructed where the multiplicative result of the second and third digits is greater than 5.\n\nTo complete the answer, let's consider the remaining steps:\n\n1. **Determine the range for the first digit**: Since the number must surpass 2999, the first digit (thousands place) can be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. This provides us with 7 options for the first digit.\n\n2. **Determine the conditions for the second and third digits**: The product of the second (hundreds place) and third (tens place) digits must be greater than 5. The digits can range from 0 to 9, so we need to find all pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a \\times b > 5\\).\n\n3. **Calculate valid (a, b) pairs**:\n   - Consider \\(a = 0\\): No valid pairs since any product will be 0.\n   - Consider \\(a = 1\\): \\(b\\) must be greater than 5, so valid \\(b\\) values are 6, 7, 8, 9. (4 pairs)\n   - Consider \\(a = 2\\): \\(b\\) must be greater than 2.5, so valid \\(b\\) values are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. (7 pairs)\n   - Consider \\(a = 3\\): \\(b\\) must be greater than 1.666..., so valid \\(b\\) values are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. (8 pairs)\n   - Consider \\(a = 4\\): \\(b\\) must be greater than 1.25, so valid \\(b\\) values are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. (8 pairs)\n   - Consider \\(a = 5\\): \\(b\\) must be greater than 1, so valid \\(b\\) values are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. (8 pairs)\n   - Consider \\(a = 6\\): \\(b\\) must be greater than 0.833..., so valid \\(b\\) values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Thus, there are 8 possibilities.\n- If \\(a = 6\\), then \\(a \\times b = 6b\\). For \\(6b > 5\\), any \\(b > 0\\) will work. So, possibilities are \\(b = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\).

      "solution_prefix": "How many four-digit numbers greater than 2999 can be formed such that the product of the middle two digits exceeds 5?\n\nTo solve this problem, let's first consider the structure of a four-digit number greater than 2999. Such a number can be represented as \\(\\overline{abcd}\\), where \\(a, b, c, d\\) are digits and \\(a \\geq 3\\).\n\n1. **Determine the Range for \\(a\\):**\n\n    Since the number must be greater than 2999, \\(a\\) can be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, giving us 7 possible choices for \\(a\\).\n\n2. **Calculate Middle Digits Product Constraint:**\n\n    The condition on the middle two digits, \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), is \\(b \\cdot c > 5\\). We need to count the pairs \\((b, c)\\) such that \\(0 \\leq b, c \\leq 9\\) and \\(b \\cdot c > 5\\).\n\n    - If \\(b = 0\\), \\(b \\cdot c\\) is always 0, so no valid pairs.\n    - If \\(b = 1\\), valid \\(c\\) values are 6, 7, 8, 9 (since \\(1 \\cdot c > 5\\)), giving 4 pairs.\n    - If \\(b = 2\\), valid \\(c\\) values are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, giving 7 pairs.\n    - If \\(b = 3\\), valid \\(c\\) values are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, giving 8 pairs.\n    - If \\(b = 4\\), valid \\(c\\) values are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, giving 8 pairs.\n    - If \\(b = 5\\), valid \\(c\\) values are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, giving 8 pairs.\n    - If \\(b = 6\\), valid \\(c\\) values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, giving 9 pairs.\n    - If \\(b = 7\\), valid \\(c\\) values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, giving 9 pairs.\n    - If \\(b = 8\\), valid \\(c\\) values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, giving 9 pairs.\n    - If \\(b = 9\\), valid \\(c\\) values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, giving 9 pairs.\n\n    Therefore, the total number of valid \\((b, c)\\) pairs is:\n\n    \\(0 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 71\\) pairs.\n\n3. **Determine the Range for \\(d\\):**\n\n    The digit \\(d\\) can take any value from 0 to 9, giving us 10 possible choices for \\(d\\).\n\n4. **Total Number of Valid Numbers:**\n\n    Combine the choices for each digit:\n\n    \\[\n    7 \\, (choices \\, for \\, a) \\times 71 \\, (valid \\, pairs \\, for \\, b \\, and \\, c) \\times 10 \\, (choices \\, for \\, d) = 4970\n    \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 4970 four-digit numbers greater than 2999 such that the product of the middle two digits exceeds 5.",
