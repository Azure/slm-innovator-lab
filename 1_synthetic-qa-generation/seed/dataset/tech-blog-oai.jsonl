If you are comfortable with your existing training environment, you don't need to adopt MLflow, although it makes training and deploying models on Azure ML very convenient.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How do you start and end an experiment in MLflow within a training script?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In your training script, you use `mlflow.start_run()` to start an experiment in MLflow and `mlflow.end_run()` to end the experiment when it is finished. Wrapping it in `with` syntax eliminates the need to explicitly call `end_run()`. You can perform MLflow logging inside an MLflow block using functions like `mlflow.log_params()`, `mlflow.log_metric()`, and `mlflow.log_image()`.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What should you do if you are using the Florence-2 model, which does not support `mlflow.transformers.log_model()`?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you are using the Florence-2 model, which does not support `mlflow.transformers.log_model()` as of July 2, 2024, you must save the model with the traditional `save_pretrained()`. Additionally, when saving with `save_pretrained()`, you need to include additional dependency codes required for model inference by copying them to the model directory."}]}

It is less than 1B in size, with the base model being 0.23B and the large model being 0.77B. It is efficient for vision and vision-language tasks such as OCR, captioning, object detection, and instance segmentation.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a Conda environment in Azure ML?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The advantages of using a Conda environment include simple environment setup, quick setup, and a lightweight environment as it mainly installs specific packages. The disadvantages are limited flexibility in handling complex system-level dependencies and portability limitations, as it primarily consists of Python and Conda packages, making it difficult to include other languages or complex system components.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How can data assets be managed in Azure ML, and what are the default datastores created in an Azure ML workspace?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Data assets in Azure ML can be managed by uploading datasets directly or registering them as Data assets in the Azure ML workspace, enabling versioning and ensuring data quality and reproducibility. When an Azure ML workspace is created, four default datastores are automatically created: `workspaceworkingdirectory`, `workspaceartifactstore`, `workspacefilestore`, and `workspaceblobstore`. The `workspaceblobstore` is Azure Blob Storage, used by default for storing model training data or large files."}]}
